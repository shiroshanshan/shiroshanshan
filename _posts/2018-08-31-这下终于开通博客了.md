<font face="微软雅黑">转眼来日本也是快有一年了，自从羽毛同学走了之后<b>（！）</b>，连平时闲聊的对象都没有了，为了防止变得自闭233，同时鼓励自己今后也多多在上面记录，第一次博客的内容还是要写的认真一些的。  
再犹豫了很久到底写什么好之后，想到介绍一下来这边之后读的第一篇论文<a href='https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10514-016-9604-y.pdf'>A confidence-based roadmap using Gaussian process regression</a><s>（似乎暴露了什么）</s>

Sample-based motion planning, Gaussian process regression, Probability roadmap  

## Abstract  
This paper proposed a method of motion planning by sampling from probablistic roadmap constructed by gaussian process.  

## Some mothod metioned in this paper  
### Motion Planning
* **RRT(Rapidly exploring Random Tree):**  the details of RRT can be found in this [page](https://blog.csdn.net/gpeng832/article/details/71249198?locationNum=1&fps=1).  
* **PRM(Probabilistic RoadMap):** PRM is used in this study, for more detailed information can be found in this [page](https://blog.csdn.net/chauncygu/article/details/78032283).  
* **APF(Artificial Potential Field Method):** APF can generate smooth route, but is easy to converge to local optimal. More details can be found in this [page](https://blog.csdn.net/huangg900/article/details/80503306).  

### Others  
* **LSH(Locality Sensitive Hashing):** LSH is used as a faster method in calculating GP. LSH is a hash algorithm that can classfy near data to the same bin with a high prossibility. And a LSH hash function is needed in this algorithm. More details can be found in this [page](https://www.cnblogs.com/wt869054461/p/8148940.html).
* **SLAM(simultaneous localization and mapping):** for more information, click [this](http://www.360doc.com/content/16/0509/17/33166754_557617018.shtml).

## Some notes  
* In the paper of PRM algorithm, milestone is randomly sampled in roadmap, and action can be generated from the link betwenn different milestones.  
* State represent all the information the robot can used in motion planning(inside and outside), so interval cost and outside cost need to be set in this study.
* When using randomly sampled milestones, as in an existing methods, most of the milestones might be isolated and thus ignorable for path planning, owing to the sparse data.
* The problem of reconstructing the internal forces and/or torques from the movements and known external forces is called the 'inverse dynamics problem', whereas calculating motion from known internal forces and/or torques and resulting reaction forces is called the 'forward dynamics problem'.
* How to shape cost function in motion planning.  
* Thw comparation between planned motion and actually achieved motion.
